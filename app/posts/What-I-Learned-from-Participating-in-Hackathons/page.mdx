# My Journey Through Hackathons: Challenges, Growth, and Lessons Learned

Since I took my first steps into programming, I was always looking for motivation and a place where I could connect with people who shared the same interests. I joined Facebook groups, local tech communities, and talked with more experienced developers always asking about their motivations, their market challenges, and the mistakes they had made. I’ve always loved listening to stories from more experienced developers because I believed that it could help me avoid making the same mistakes.

Over time, I noticed something interesting: I learned much faster when I was under pressure. Strange, right? But it’s true. It awakened a kind of competitive spirit in me — not against others, but against myself. I always wanted to improve.

## What is a Hackathon?

If you're a student, a recent graduate, or even a junior developer, you've probably heard the word _Hackathon_. A hackathon is an event that gathers developers, designers, and tech professionals in an intense programming marathon. The goal is simple: develop a solution or software to solve a real problem all within a very short time.

These events can last from 24 hours to a full week, depending on the organization. But one thing is certain: the intensity is guaranteed.

## My First Experience

Right after I finished high school, I had already done some freelance projects, but I felt stuck and needed new challenges. A friend suggested that I join a hackathon. At first, I was scared I didn’t know exactly what it was and didn’t think I had the skills to participate. But he had experience and encouraged me to try.

We registered together for the first Acelera Angola hackathon. When we arrived, we were divided into teams with people I had never met before. We were separated by role project manager, front-end, back-end, etc. Surprisingly, my friend ended up in another team. He became my direct competitor!

I was responsible for the front-end part of our project. We had 24 hours to create a fintech solution. It was tough, especially because it was my first time and I didn’t fully understand the process. Each group had to choose a real problem from the Angolan context.

Our team created “Investime me”. It was a remarkable experience. Communication was essential, and everyone had to take responsibility. That was when I truly understood the value of teamwork and collaborative leadership. And guess what? We finished in 3rd place and won 200,000 Kz!

## Biggest Challenges

One major challenge was time management. Most of the hackathons I joined lasted only 24 hours, which forced us to be very strategic. You must know how to prioritize to deliver at least a functional MVP.

Another big challenge was communication. Under pressure, it’s easy to let stress take over. Sometimes, unexpected technical problems or scope changes occurred in the middle of the competition very frustrating. In those moments, I learned to stay calm, analyze the problem, and find realistic solutions with the resources we had. It was a true lesson in emotional intelligence and critical thinking.

## Skills and Knowledge Gained

One of the most powerful lessons I heard from a mentor during a hackathon was:

> “Fall in love with the problem, not the solution.”

That phrase stuck with me. Today, I understand that deeply understanding the problem is more important than being attached to a beautiful solution. It completely changes how you approach projects.

Hackathons helped me develop:

- Fast and practical problem-solving
- Ability to use new technologies quickly
- How to build a functional MVP in a short time
- How to present a clear and objective pitch

## Tips for Those Who Want to Join a Hackathon

- Choose a hackathon with a topic that inspires you.
- If you already have a team, communicate frequently and clearly.
- Divide tasks well everyone should know their role.
- Give attention to the pitch a great idea presented poorly loses impact.
- Enjoy the experience ask, learn, experiment, and have fun!

## Final Thoughts

Fear and insecurity were always part of me. But instead of letting them stop me, I decided to face them. Participating in hackathons was, without a doubt, one of the most enriching experiences of my life. It changed the way I see problems, teamwork, and even how I think about solutions.

I had the opportunity to participate in four hackathons, in two different countries, and it changed my life in ways I could never imagine. It was an amazing opportunity for both professional and personal growth and yes, it was also a great way to earn some money when I needed it most.

Each hackathon brought a new challenge, a new team, new lessons, and new friendships. So, I leave my sincere thanks to all the people I had the privilege of working with. Each one contributed to my growth, and I carry their lessons with me.

If you're thinking about joining a hackathon go for it. It's challenging, yes, but it’s also transformative. And this is just my perspective or maybe a small reflection on how valuable this journey can be.
