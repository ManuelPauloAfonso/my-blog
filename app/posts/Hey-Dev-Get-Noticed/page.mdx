# **Hey Programmer, Be Noticed!**

Yes, that’s right. Before you judge that phrase as too bold or even arrogant, let me explain the motivation behind writing this article.

I always felt the need to find balance in my professional life — a space where I could reflect on my frustrations, challenges, and lessons I learned, many of which I realized too late.

I write because it allows me to express my thoughts and emotions. Sometimes, the solution to our problems is much closer than we imagine — but when we don’t understand where we’re heading or which decisions to make in our professional life, we can easily end up on the wrong path.

This article is the start of a series of four reflections, where I will share the topics that made a real impact on my life — both personally and professionally. At 22 years old, I feel like I’ve lived many lifetimes because of the experiences I’ve gone through. Those experiences shaped my maturity and helped me understand where I am and which direction to follow, perhaps in a less painful way.

When we are young, we want everything fast. We don’t want advice. We make mistakes that could have been avoided if we had listened to more experienced people. Having someone wiser by your side can make a huge difference in your professional journey. Don’t hesitate to ask for advice. My father used to tell me: _“When the head doesn’t think, the body suffers.”_ It sounded like a joke back then — now it makes perfect sense.

These lessons helped me get to where I am today. Even though I’m not yet close to where I want to be, I feel grateful. Some lessons arrived late, but it’s never too late to restart. Like the idea that English should have been my first language before any programming language. Today, that makes perfect sense.

It’s not about regret — I’ve paid my price already. It’s about helping others who might be going through similar challenges.

I also realized I’m terrible in videos (haha), so writing feels like freedom — like starting over.

## **So... Why Be Noticed?**

Let’s begin with the opposite: **not being noticed** means staying comfortable in your personal, non-collaborative projects.

But think about it: if I’m building a library for my project, that same library might be used and improved by thousands of developers worldwide. And that’s the beauty of **open source** — we grow because others helped us, and now we help others.

There is nothing wrong with personal projects. But the real question is:

> **For how long will you build only for yourself?**

I used to think differently until I experienced the power of collaboration. Working with people I didn’t know — and learning from them — was more valuable than any “from zero to expert” online course. And it was free.

## **The Power of Open Source and Networking**

We depend on open-source software every day. I use Linux — open source. Sometimes I feel bad for not contributing. It made me curious about the teams behind these tools. How were they built? Who created them? Could I help?

Open Source and **Networking** are deeply connected.

When you collaborate in open-source projects, you connect with developers from different countries, cultures, and experiences. That can bring real opportunities — both professionally and personally.

How do you become noticed?

- By contributing to open-source projects
- By helping others
- By documenting what you learn
- By sharing your journey

Your work becomes public, visible, and valuable. Companies and developers can see your growth, how you write code, how you communicate, how you solve problems.

This, for me, is still one of the **best ways to create career opportunities**.

## **Prestige Is Not Vanity**

One of the articles that most influenced me was _The Prestige Ladder_ by David Reais. It completely changed how I understand recognition.

**Prestige**: Gained through respect, influence, and trust — earned by real contribution and impact.  
**Vanity**: The exaggerated desire for admiration without real value behind it.

Prestige comes from building something meaningful, helping others, and being consistent.  
Vanity comes from wanting attention without delivering real value.

Prestige is not about salary. It’s about impact, technical respect, and trust.

## **Tips to Be Noticed for the Right Reason**

- Build presence through **ethics, humility, and consistency**
- Contribute to something bigger than yourself
- Share knowledge — not for likes, but for learning
- Build trust, not image
- Remember: you are always being observed — even when it seems like no one is watching

## **Final Thoughts**

Reputation takes **time to build**, but **seconds to destroy**.  
Being noticed is **not about forcing attention**, but about letting your work speak for you.

In the next articles of this series, I will share more technical and personal lessons I wish I had known earlier — especially in my early high school days when all I wanted was to grow professionally but had no idea where to start.

This is just the beginning.  
**Be noticed but for the right reasons.**
