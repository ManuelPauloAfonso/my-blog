This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## My Personal Tech Blog

This is my personal space a blog where I share what I learn, what I build, and what I discover as a developer.
I used to write on platforms like Medium and other content networks, but I eventually realized something important:
My knowledge deserves a home, and I wanted to share it with the world.
I wanted to create a space where I could share my learning journey, my experiences, and my insights with the community.
I wanted to create a space where I could showcase my skills, my projects, and my passion for technology.
Here, I have full control.
Here, I can write freely.
Here, I can build, document, and grow both as a learner and a developer.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
